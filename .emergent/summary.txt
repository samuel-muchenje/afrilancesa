The previous AI engineer successfully expanded the Afrilance application's functionality. The trajectory began with the user's request to implement Phase 1 Admin Dashboard features, which included User Management, System Statistics, and Support Tickets. The AI engineer meticulously added new backend endpoints in  and then updated  to integrate these features on the frontend. After successfully testing Phase 1 backend, the user provided requirements for Phase 2: Advanced Features, encompassing Revenue Monitoring, Advanced Search & Filters, and a Review & Rating System. The engineer again followed the pattern of implementing backend models and endpoints in , then creating new frontend components (, , ) and integrating them into , , and . The process involved iterative development, backend testing, and continuous updates to .

The Afrilance platform is a secure freelance marketplace for verified South African users, supporting Freelancer, Client, and Admin roles. The initial vision included a dark-themed UI, robust authentication, job posting/browsing, basic dashboards, and specific aesthetic demands for a redesigned homepage with abstract SVG animations, dynamic categories, and featured sections. The backend required comprehensive  data, ID document uploads with email notifications to , and a high-priority Wallet system with auto-creation, escrow, and withdrawal. Subsequent requirements involved realistic South African data, ZAR currency, public freelancer profiles, and fully functional site navigation. Comprehensive file upload capabilities for portfolios, profile pictures, project galleries, and resumes were implemented. A dedicated admin login system with  domain restriction and an approval workflow (verifications/admin approvals to ) was also added. Recent fixes included addressing go back home navigation on signup, ensuring all platform links function correctly, adding moving backgrounds, and fixing non-functional Company footer links (About, Careers, Contact, Press). The ongoing development focuses on expanding the Admin Dashboard with user management, system statistics, support tickets, revenue monitoring, advanced search/filters, and a review/rating system.
