The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Afrilance application from an MVP to a near-production state, iteratively addressing core functionalities and critical bug fixes. Initial work involved establishing core authentication, a dark-themed UI, and robust backend user management, including a Contracts system. Key development efforts during this trajectory focused on implementing a comprehensive Wallet system, from backend models and escrow logic to frontend dashboard integration. Subsequently, the engineer meticulously resolved critical UI/UX bugs, including a persistent issue with missing navigation headers and a full-screen logo overlay, adapting the CSS for responsive display across all screen sizes. Furthermore, a significant effort was made to enhance site navigation by creating new pages (e.g., About, Contact, Browse Jobs) and linking all previously non-functional elements like categories, footer links, and featured freelancers to establish a complete and realistic user flow. The engineer also ensured all demo data was replaced with realistic South African specifics and confirmed ZAR currency formatting.

<product_requirements>
The Afrilance platform aims to be a freelance marketplace for verified South African freelancers and clients, supporting Freelancer, Client, and Admin roles. Initial design specified a dark theme with green-yellow branding, specific fonts (Proxima Nova/Inter/Satoshi), rounded buttons, card lift effects, and sticky navigation. Core functionalities include user authentication with role-based access, job posting, browsing, and bidding, alongside basic dashboards. A key aesthetic requirement was a detailed homepage redesign featuring abstract SVG animations and sections like Dynamic Categories, Featured Freelancers, How It Works, Why Afrilance, Testimonials, Mobile App Promo, and a Sticky CTA Footer. Backend requirements included a  collection with comprehensive fields (e.g., , , , ), ID document uploads, and an integrated support email system to , and in-app messaging. Later, the user requested a full-fledged Wallet system with features like auto-creation for freelancers, escrow handling tied to contract acceptance, and withdrawal functionalities, explicitly prioritizing it over the email service. Finally, realistic data, correct currency (ZAR), public freelancer profiles, and fully functional site navigation (categories, footer links) were demanded.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture**: React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
- **UI/UX**: Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI components, responsive design, dark theme.
- **Authentication**: JWT, bcrypt (password hashing), role-based access control.
- **Data Management**: MongoDB collections (, , , , ).
- **File Handling**: Backend support for ID document uploads.
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes, Supervisor.

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, leveraging MongoDB for data persistence.

**Directory Structure:**

- :
    - **Importance**: Main FastAPI application, defines API endpoints, handles database interactions, authentication, and business logic.
    - **Changes**: Enhanced  and  schemas. Implemented JWT auth, bcrypt hashing. Most recently, added  Pydantic model and new  endpoints for wallet creation, balance updates, transactions (deposit, withdraw, escrow release). Modified  to auto-create wallets for freelancers. Updated  to handle escrow funds by updating the freelancer's wallet. Added new endpoint  to fetch public freelancer profiles for the homepage.
- :
    - **Importance**: Stores environment variables like  and .
    - **Changes**: No direct changes were explicitly shown in the trajectory, but it is implied to be used for MongoDB and potentially the support email system.
- :
    - **Importance**: Central React component managing global state, routing, and rendering of different application pages.
    - **Changes**: Integrated  as the homepage, refactored API calls, and implemented routing for , , , , , , . Crucially, routing was expanded to include newly created pages: , , , , and . Routing logic was adjusted to ensure  is the default for unauthenticated users, fixing the homepage overlay bug.
- :
    - **Importance**: Global CSS for dark theme, typography, and component styling.
    - **Changes**: Extensive updates for the dark theme, new color palette, and styling. Most recently, critical fixes for the  class were applied to prevent a full-screen logo overlay issue by setting fixed heights (,  for large screens) and  constraints (, ), along with a media query for large screens.
- :
    - **Importance**: Dedicated component for the visually rich, redesigned homepage.
    - **Changes**: Created to implement detailed visual requirements. It was significantly updated to fix navigation headers, changing  to . Added padding () to hero section. Updated to dynamically fetch  from the backend API instead of using static data. All categories, footer links, and header navigation buttons were linked to their respective new or existing pages (e.g., , , , , , ). Static  and  arrays were removed/updated with realistic South African data.
- :
    - **Importance**: User registration interface.
    - **Changes**: Created to include fields for user details. A Back to Home navigation button was added.
- :
    - **Importance**: Main dashboard for logged-in freelancers.
    - **Changes**: Developed into a comprehensive dashboard. Recently, it was updated to integrate the new Wallet system, including a dedicated Wallet tab, displaying available balance, escrow balance, and transaction history. Functionality for withdrawal was added with corresponding UI elements.
- :
    - **Importance**: Main dashboard for logged-in clients.
    - **Changes**: Developed into a comprehensive dashboard. It was updated to integrate the Contracts system with a Contracts tab and an Accept Proposal button for contract creation. No direct changes related to the Wallet system beyond its backend integration via contracts.
- , , , , :
    - **Importance**: Newly created placeholder components to provide proper navigation targets and complete the user flow.
    - **Changes**: These files were created as basic React components to serve as landing pages for their respective routes, making the site's navigation fully functional.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Complete implementation of the  component.
- Implement the email service integration for the support system (originally requested, but user prioritized Wallet system).
- Develop the basic in-app messaging system.
- Implement advanced search & filters, payment integration, review & rating system, and portfolio showcase.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving a critical **full-screen logo overlay bug** that manifested specifically when the application was viewed in full-screen browser mode. This bug caused a massive 1000x1000px logo to obscure the entire homepage content, despite previous fixes for missing headers.

The investigation revealed that while the navigation header logo had a correct  class, the global  CSS rule in  lacked proper maximum height constraints for larger viewports. It had  and , allowing the high-resolution logo image to scale excessively in full-screen mode.

To resolve this, the engineer modified :
- The  rule's  was changed to , and a  was added.
- A media query for  was introduced to apply slightly larger dimensions (, ) for very large screens, ensuring the logo remains appropriately sized without overscaling.

This fix successfully eliminated the full-screen logo overlay, making the homepage content fully visible and accessible across all screen sizes, from mobile to ultra-wide displays. This was the last task completed, bringing the Afrilance homepage to a fully functional and responsively designed state.
