The AI engineer successfully progressed the Afrilance application, addressing a mix of bug fixes and significant feature additions. Initially, the focus was on critical UI/UX bugs, specifically a persistent navigation header issue and a full-screen logo overlay, both resolved by refining CSS and React routing logic. A major iterative effort involved enhancing site navigation by creating multiple new pages (e.g., About, Contact, Browse Jobs, How It Works, Browse Freelancers, Enterprise, and a full For Freelancers section), and ensuring all navigation links, including footer elements, were fully functional and correctly routed.

Subsequent work centered on data storage and file management. The engineer analyzed existing MongoDB and local file system usage for user data and ID documents, then implemented a comprehensive file upload system, adding capabilities for profile pictures, resumes, portfolios, and project galleries, complete with backend endpoints and frontend integration. The final major development involved creating a dedicated, secure admin login system with domain restrictions for  emails, and a robust approval workflow with email notifications to  for both admin requests and user verifications. The trajectory shows a consistent pattern of iterative development, thorough debugging, and immediate testing of implemented features.

<product_requirements>
The Afrilance platform is designed as a freelance marketplace for verified South African freelancers and clients, supporting Freelancer, Client, and Admin roles. Initial requirements included a dark-themed UI, robust authentication, job posting/browsing, and basic dashboards. Key aesthetic demands were a redesigned homepage with abstract SVG animations, dynamic categories, and featured sections (Freelancers, How It Works, Testimonials). Backend specified comprehensive  data, ID document uploads, and an integrated support email to . A high-priority Wallet system with auto-creation, escrow handling, and withdrawal was later requested. Subsequent user demands included realistic South African data, ZAR currency, public freelancer profiles, and fully functional site navigation. The user further requested comprehensive file upload capabilities for portfolios, profile pictures, project galleries, and resumes. Most recently, a dedicated admin login system with  domain restriction and an approval workflow sending all verification/admin approval emails to  was explicitly requested for enhanced security and management.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer successfully implemented a **dedicated, secure admin login system**. This involved creating a new frontend component, , which provides a professional login interface and includes a Request Access tab for new administrators. This request form enforces a domain restriction, requiring  email addresses.

On the backend, new endpoints were added to  for handling admin authentication () and processing new admin access requests (). A critical new endpoint, , was added to manage the approval/rejection workflow for these requests. These backend changes ensure that new admin accounts are created with an  status and require explicit approval from an existing administrator.

The  was significantly refactored to integrate this new workflow, adding new states and functions to fetch and display pending admin requests. A dedicated Admin Requests tab was added to the dashboard, allowing existing admins to review, approve, or reject new access requests. Both the applicant and  receive email notifications regarding the status of admin requests, ensuring a complete and auditable approval process.

Furthermore, the existing user verification process was updated to also send all verification approval emails to , and frontend pages (, ) were updated to consistently direct users to this email for verification queries. The main navigation in  was updated to include a prominent Admin button that leads to the new dedicated admin login page, making the system accessible. The system is now production-ready for secure admin access and management.
