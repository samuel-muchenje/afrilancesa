The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the Afrilance marketplace, building from scratch. Initially, core functionality like authentication and job management was prioritized. A significant portion of the work involved a complete visual overhaul, transforming the UI into a modern, dark-themed platform with specific branding and custom African-centric imagery. New professional logos were integrated across the site. Backend enhancements included a comprehensive Users collection with detailed fields, role-based access control, and ID document upload capabilities. Dedicated registration and login pages were implemented with conditional UI and role-based redirects. Several UI bugs, particularly concerning persistent popups/banners on the homepage, were addressed through iterative debugging and frontend code modifications. The trajectory concludes with the creation of the login page and its associated placeholder dashboard components, indicating the immediate next steps involve fleshing out this login functionality.

The user tasked the AI engineer with setting up Afrilance, a freelance marketplace connecting verified South African freelancers with clients. Key roles include Freelancer, Client, and Admin. Design specifications involve a Proxima Nova font, a specific green-yellow color palette (#387F39, #A2CA71, #BEDC74, #F6E96B), rounded buttons with hover effects, card lift effects, sticky navigation, and in-app messaging/support icons for logged-in users. An integrated support system sending submissions to  and an in-app messaging system () were required.

The core functionality prioritized includes authentication with role control, job posting (Client), job browsing & bidding (Freelancer), and basic dashboards. A major design overhaul was requested for the homepage, featuring a deep black background, abstract SVG animations in the brand palette, Inter/Satoshi typography, and sections like Dynamic Categories, Featured Freelancers, How It Works, Why Afrilance, Testimonials, Mobile App Promo, and a Sticky CTA Footer. New logos incorporating the African continent silhouette were provided and integrated.

A detailed  collection was specified for the backend, including , , , , , , , and , with enabled user authentication and role-based access control. Dedicated  and  pages were required with conditional fields (ID upload for freelancers) and role-based redirects post-submission/login. Multiple bugs related to persistent, forced popups/banners on the landing page were reported and resolved.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, utilizing MongoDB as its database.

**Directory Structure:**


-   :
    -   **Importance**: This is the main FastAPI application file handling all API endpoints, database interactions, and business logic.
    -   **Changes**: Initial setup for the marketplace foundation, including core API routes. Enhanced the  collection structure, added JWT-based authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, and unique email constraints. Implemented file upload functionality for ID documents with validation. Introduced role-based access control for job applications. A missing support endpoint was re-integrated.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Stores environment-specific variables for the backend, such as database URLs and sensitive credentials.
    -   **Changes**: The  variable was added to facilitate the support system's email sending capabilities.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: The central React component managing application state, routing logic, and rendering of different pages.
    -   **Changes**: Initial rendering of the application with basic marketplace features. Refactored API call handling to include timeouts and better error management. Updated to integrate the  component as the new homepage. Implemented routing for , , , , , and . Incorporated the new Afrilance logos and ensured the Auth page and Dashboard components matched the modern dark theme. Logic was added to conditionally hide modals on the landing page and the persistent top navigation banner was hidden.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on creating the dedicated  page and setting up the initial structure for role-based dashboards.

The following files were created as part of this effort:
- : This file was initiated to serve as the new login page. It's expected to contain input fields for email and password, a login button, and logic to handle user authentication against the backend's  collection. Upon successful login, it should manage session saving and redirect users based on their assigned role.
- : This file was created as a placeholder component for the dashboard that freelancers will access upon successful login.
- : This file was also created as a placeholder component, intended for clients to be redirected to after logging in.
- The  was mentioned as a redirect target in the  page requirements but its creation was not explicitly confirmed within the trajectory.

The work for the login page and dashboards is currently in its initial file creation phase, implying the core logic for authentication, session management, and role-based routing within these new components still needs to be implemented. The trajectory ends right after the creation of .
