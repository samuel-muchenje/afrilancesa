The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on the Afrilance application, initially focusing on addressing critical user-reported bugs after the Phase 2 Portfolio Showcase System completion. The primary challenge became persistent email delivery issues to , despite initial automated tests indicating resolution. This led to a deep dive into email configuration, initially correcting an SMTP host error ( to ), then fully migrating the email system to Postmark API upon user request. Subsequent to this, a new bug emerged where Postmark emails weren't delivering, identified as issues with the  field in Postmark API calls and the  not loading correctly via . These were systematically fixed, leading to successful end-to-end email delivery confirmed via backend logs and a request for user confirmation.

<product_requirements>
The Afrilance platform is a secure, dark-themed freelance marketplace for verified South African users with distinct Freelancer, Client, and Admin roles. It necessitates robust authentication, job posting/browsing, comprehensive role-specific dashboards, and a Wallet/escrow system supporting ZAR currency. Backend functionalities include user data management, ID document uploads with specific email notifications, and administrative features such as User Management, System Statistics, Support Tickets, Revenue Monitoring, Advanced Search & Filters, and a Review & Rating System. Key expansions included public accessibility for verified freelancers with search and category filtering, dynamic category counts, secure JWT secret management, functional admin registration approval emails, and an enhanced Portfolio Showcase system for freelancers. The immediate problem involved critical bugs: Invalid Date display, non-functional file uploads in the Freelancer Dashboard, incorrect post-signup dashboard redirection, and critical issues with verification email delivery.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in a critical bug fix: resolving persistent email delivery failures to . This issue resurfaced even after an initial attempt to fix SMTP configuration and a subsequent full migration to Postmark API.

The work involved:
1.  **Diagnosing Postmark Failure**: Despite Postmark integration, emails weren't being delivered. Backend logs indicated the  was not being loaded, causing fallback to SMTP, which also failed due to network restrictions, finally leading to mock mode (no actual delivery).
2.  **Addressing Postmark Configuration**:
    *   It was identified that the  field, previously included in Postmark API calls, was unsupported with the provided Server token and was causing API call failures. This field was removed from the  function in .
    *   To ensure the  (and other environment variables) are properly loaded,  and  were added to .
3.  **Verification**: After these fixes, comprehensive testing was conducted using the backend testing agent. This confirmed successful, live email delivery via Postmark API, with Message IDs being returned and logged, indicating emails were indeed being sent to . The system now successfully sends admin registration requests, ID document upload notifications, and verification status updates.

The current state is that the email delivery system is fully operational and awaiting user confirmation of receipt of test emails sent to .
