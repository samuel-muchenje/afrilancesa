The AI engineer successfully progressed the Afrilance application through several key development phases. Initially, the focus was on core UI/UX bug fixes, specifically resolving persistent navigation header and logo overlay issues through CSS and React routing refinements. This was followed by a major effort to expand site navigation, creating numerous new pages (About, Contact, Browse Jobs, etc.) and ensuring all links were functional.

Subsequent work addressed data storage and file management, implementing a comprehensive upload system for profile pictures, resumes, portfolios, and project galleries, complete with backend endpoints and frontend integration. A significant security enhancement involved creating a dedicated admin login system with domain restrictions and a robust approval workflow, including email notifications. The most recent efforts centered on building a comprehensive in-app messaging system and resolving critical navigation bugs (e.g., go back home on signup, non-functional footer links), alongside adding aesthetic enhancements like moving backgrounds and glow effects. The process involved iterative development, detailed debugging, and consistent testing.

<product_requirements>
The Afrilance platform is envisioned as a secure freelance marketplace for verified South African freelancers and clients, supporting Freelancer, Client, and Admin roles. Initial requirements included a dark-themed UI, robust authentication, job posting/browsing, and basic dashboards, with specific aesthetic demands for a redesigned homepage featuring abstract SVG animations, dynamic categories, and featured sections. The backend needed comprehensive  data, ID document uploads with email notifications to , and a high-priority Wallet system with auto-creation, escrow, and withdrawal. Subsequent demands specified realistic South African data, ZAR currency, public freelancer profiles, and fully functional site navigation. Comprehensive file upload capabilities for portfolios, profile pictures, project galleries, and resumes were added. Most recently, a dedicated admin login system with  domain restriction and an approval workflow (all verifications/admin approvals to ) was implemented. Following this, the user requested a fix for the go back home page on signup, ensuring all platform buttons/links function correctly, and adding moving backgrounds for visual enhancement. Finally, the user reported non-functional Company footer links (About, Careers, Contact, Press).
