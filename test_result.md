# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "CRITICAL BUG CONFIRMED - ADMIN REGISTRATION APPROVAL WORKFLOW ISSUE IDENTIFIED! ❌ ROOT CAUSE FOUND: EMAIL_PASSWORD is empty in backend/.env file causing SMTP authentication failures. ✅ ENDPOINT FUNCTIONALITY: POST /api/admin/register-request endpoint is properly implemented with correct domain validation (@afrilance.co.za only), comprehensive data validation (email, password, full_name, phone, department, reason), user creation with admin_approved=false status, verification_status='pending_admin_approval' status. ✅ DATABASE STORAGE: Admin users are correctly created in database with all required fields (department, admin_request_reason, admin_request_date, admin_approved=false). ✅ SECURITY VALIDATION: Domain restriction working (only @afrilance.co.za emails accepted), duplicate registration properly blocked, pending admin login correctly blocked with 403 status. ❌ EMAIL SENDING FAILURE: send_email() function fails with 'Connection timed out' error when attempting SMTP authentication to mail.afrilance.co.za:465. This occurs because EMAIL_PASSWORD environment variable is empty, causing server.login(EMAIL_USER, EMAIL_PASS) to fail. The email sending failure causes the entire admin registration request to hang and timeout. ❌ IMPACT: Admin registration requests are submitted and stored in database correctly, but approval notification emails to sam@afrilance.co.za are never sent, leaving admin requests unnoticed. ✅ BACKEND LOGS EVIDENCE: Multiple log entries show 'Failed to send email: [Errno 110] Connection timed out' and '❌ Failed to send admin approval request for [User Name]'. 💡 SOLUTION REQUIRED: Set EMAIL_PASSWORD in backend/.env file with correct SMTP password for sam@afrilance.co.za account, then restart backend service.
