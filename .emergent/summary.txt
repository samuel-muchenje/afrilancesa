The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the Afrilance marketplace, progressing from foundational setup to comprehensive feature implementation. Key work included establishing core authentication, a complete visual overhaul to a dark-themed UI, and robust backend user management with role-based access. Frontend development saw the creation and enhancement of dedicated registration, login, Freelancer Dashboard, Client Dashboard, Freelancer Profile Setup, and Post Job pages. UI bugs, particularly persistent popups, were addressed. The engineer iteratively refined frontend components, fixing lint and JSX errors. Backend development focused on JWT-based authentication, ID document uploads, and crucially, the implementation of a Contracts system, including a new MongoDB collection and trigger logic for proposal acceptance. The trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach, with regular backend and frontend testing, and direct engagement with user priorities, ensuring a progressive build-out of a functional freelance platform.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to establish Afrilance, a freelance marketplace for verified South African freelancers and clients, supporting roles like Freelancer, Client, and Admin. Design specifications included a dark theme with specific green-yellow branding, Proxima Nova/Inter/Satoshi fonts, rounded buttons, card lift effects, and sticky navigation. Core functionalities required were user authentication with role-based access, job posting, job browsing/bidding, and basic dashboards. A major homepage redesign with abstract SVG animations and specific content sections (Dynamic Categories, Featured Freelancers, How It Works, Why Afrilance, Testimonials, Mobile App Promo, Sticky CTA Footer) was a key aesthetic demand. Backend requirements involved a detailed  collection with fields like , , , , , , , and , alongside file upload capabilities for ID documents. An integrated support system sending emails to  and an in-app messaging system were also specified.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture**: React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
- **UI/UX**: Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI components, responsive design, dark theme.
- **Authentication**: JWT, bcrypt (password hashing), role-based access control.
- **Data Management**: MongoDB collections (Users, Jobs, Applications, Contracts).
- **File Handling**: Backend support for ID document uploads.
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes, Supervisor.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, leveraging MongoDB for data persistence.

**Directory Structure:**

- :
    - **Importance**: Main FastAPI application, defines API endpoints, handles database interactions, authentication, and business logic.
    - **Changes**: Enhanced  collection schema, implemented JWT-based auth, bcrypt hashing, unique email constraints, and ID document upload. Role-based access for job applications. Most recently, a  Pydantic model was added, and new endpoints for  were implemented to manage contract creation, retrieval, and status updates, including logic to create a contract upon client acceptance of a job proposal.
- :
    - **Importance**: Stores environment variables like  and .
    - **Changes**: No direct changes were explicitly shown in the trajectory, but it is implied to be used for MongoDB and potentially the support email system.
- :
    - **Importance**: Central React component managing global state, routing, and rendering of different application pages.
    - **Changes**: Integrated  as the homepage, refactored API calls, implemented routing for , , , , , , and . Logic for conditional UI (e.g., hiding modals) was added. Crucially, it manages the  state and renders the appropriate component based on the URL. Edits were made to address lint errors and integrate newly developed components.
- :
    - **Importance**: Global CSS for dark theme, typography, and component styling.
    - **Changes**: Extensive updates for the dark theme, new color palette, and styling for custom elements like Afrilance logos and the CTA bar.
- :
    - **Importance**: Dedicated component for the visually rich, redesigned homepage.
    - **Changes**: Created to implement detailed visual requirements including hero section, categories, testimonials, and mobile app promo. It integrates branding elements and handles dynamic UI states like the dismissible CTA.
- :
    - **Importance**: User registration interface.
    - **Changes**: Created to include fields for user details and a role dropdown. Implements conditional UI for ID document upload for Freelancer role, submission handling, and role-based redirects.
- :
    - **Importance**: User authentication interface.
    - **Changes**: Created to handle email/password input, authentication, and role-based redirects post-login. Logic was implemented to connect with the backend authentication system.
- :
    - **Importance**: Guides freelancers through profile completion after registration.
    - **Changes**: Initially a placeholder, it was significantly enhanced to provide a comprehensive, stepped onboarding interface for freelancers to input skills, experience, and other profile details.
- :
    - **Importance**: Allows clients to post new job listings.
    - **Changes**: Initially a placeholder, it was enhanced to provide a comprehensive, stepped interface for clients to input job details like title, description, budget, and required skills.
- :
    - **Importance**: Main dashboard for logged-in freelancers.
    - **Changes**: Initially a placeholder, it was developed into a comprehensive, tab-based dashboard including sections for job browsing, profile management, applications tracking, and earnings overview. It was also updated to integrate with the new Contracts system, displaying contracts.
- :
    - **Importance**: Main dashboard for logged-in clients.
    - **Changes**: Initially a placeholder, it was developed into a comprehensive, tab-based dashboard for job management, freelancer discovery, and project oversight. It was recently updated to integrate the new Contracts system, including a Contracts tab for managing active and past agreements, and an Accept Proposal button in the job applications modal to trigger contract creation.
- :
    - **Importance**: Placeholder component for the admin user.
    - **Changes**: The file was confirmed to exist (not created from scratch by this AI engineer), and routing was set up for it in . Its full functionality is still to be built out.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Complete implementation of the  component.
- Implement the email service integration for the support system.
- Develop the basic in-app messaging system.
- Implement advanced search & filters, payment integration, review & rating system, and portfolio showcase.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on implementing the new **Contracts system**. This involved both backend and frontend development.

On the **backend ()**, a new  Pydantic model was defined, and dedicated API endpoints for contract management were added. Crucially, logic was implemented to automatically create a contract entry in the MongoDB  collection when a client accepts a freelancer's job proposal. This ensures the workflow from job application to formal agreement is captured. Backend testing of this  reported a 96.9% success rate, indicating robust functionality.

On the **frontend ( and )**, the UI was updated to integrate with this new contracts system. Specifically:
- The  was modified to include a dedicated **Contracts tab**, allowing clients to view and manage their active and completed agreements with freelancers.
- The **job applications modal** within the  was enhanced with an **Accept Proposal button**. Clicking this button triggers the backend logic to create a new contract, linking the job, client, and selected freelancer, and setting the contract status to In Progress.
- Similarly, the  was also updated to display the contracts associated with the logged-in freelancer, providing them visibility into their ongoing and completed projects.

The last action performed was a screenshot of the application demonstrating the successful integration of the contract system, and the AI engineer was about to provide a comprehensive summary of this completed work.
